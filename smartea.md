<h2><b>Workshop on Evolutionary Algorithms for Smart Grids (SmartEA)<br>at ​GECCO 2017 in Berlin, July 15th-19th 2017</b></h2>
</center>

<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>


Sustainability is of great importance due to increasing demands and limited resources worldwide. In particular, in the field of energy production and consumption, methods are required that allow to phase generation and load efficiently. The vast extension of renewable and distributed energy sources and the growing information infrastructure enable a fine screening of producers and consumers, but require the development of tools for the analysis and understanding of large datasets about the energy grid. Key technologies in future ecological, economical and reliable energy systems are energy prediction of renewable resources, prediction of consumption as well as efficient planning and control strategies for network stability.

To enable financially and ecologically viable projects, optimization methods have taken over a key role for planning, optimizing and forecasting sustainable systems. Typically, these approaches make use of domain knowledge in order to achieve the required goal. Even in the case that explicit domain knowledge is not available, specialized methods can also handle large raw numerical sensory data directly, process them, generate reliable and just-in-time responses, and have high fault tolerance.

The main goal of this workshop is to promote the research on evolutionary algorithms in smart grids. We are seeking innovative research articles including, but not limited to the following areas:

- Energy generation and load forecasting
- Monitoring and simulation 
- Communication and control
- Demand side and smart home energy management
- Distributed energy resources
- Methods and algorithms for real-time analysis and control
- Open access datasets and tools
- Electric drive vehicles
- Renewable energy
- Smart micro-grids
- Smart sensing
- Virtual power plants

Submitted work should put an emphasis on modeling of solution spaces, on finding optimal representations and operators for evolutionary algorithms, and on employing and developing advanced evolutionary heuristics, e.g., for step size control, constraint handling, dynamic solution spaces, and multiple conflictive objectives.
