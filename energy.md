<h3><b>Description and Topics</b></h3>


Increasing energy demand and limited world resources call for sustainability, which is critical to keep up the world at the current pace. Efficiency is very relevant to contribute to this sustainability, and adequate methods of energy production and consumption are highly relevant. Optimization approaches are a crucial part of the planning, operation, and control of energy systems. However, many optimization problems in the energy domain are complex by nature since they are highly constrained and face issues related to high-dimensionality, lack of information, noisy and corrupted data as well as real-time requirements. Under these conditions, it becomes difficult to find a solution in an adequate amount of time. Even the most sophisticated exact solutions require workarounds that often lead to unsatisfactory performance and applicability of the algorithms.

Due to the difficulties of traditional algorithms to find feasible solutions for those complex problems in real-world conditions, Evolutionary Computation (EC) has emerged and demonstrated satisfactory performance in a wide variety of applications in the energy domain.

This special session aims at bringing together the latest applications of EC to optimization problems in the energy domain. The problems can be focused in different parts of the energy chain (e.g., heating, cooling, and electricity supply) and different consumer targets (e.g., residential or industrial level). Problems dealing with uncertainty, dynamic environments, and large-scale search spaces are a plus to the aim of this special session. 

Potential topics, include but not limited to:

- Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles
- Electricity markets
- Energy scheduling
- Heat and electricity joint optimization problems
- Hydrogen economy problems
- Multi-objective problems in the energy domain
- Natural gas optimization problems
- Optimal power flow in distribution and transmission
- Residential, industrial and district cooling/heating problems
- Smart grid and micro-grid problems
- Solar and wind power integration and forecast
- Super grids (continental and trans-continental transmission)
- Transportation & energy joint problems
